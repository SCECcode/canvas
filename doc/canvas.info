The NetCDF file is flat, but the model is iterated with topography.
 I need to check with my collaborators, but I think I should be able to 
generate a version with topography as well if that would be useful!

The model is on a regularized grid in geocentric coordinates.

The model is 11.5˚ in latitude (31.5˚N to 42˚N), 11˚ in longitude (-125˚E to -114˚E),
and 100 km deep. The NetCDF file has a resolution of 0.05˚x0.05˚x1 km; this is 
arbitrarily chosen, so I can manipulate the resolution as needed. If a coarser/finer
resolution would work better, let me know and I can generate a new file.  

The model provides Vpv, Vph, Vsv, Vsh, and density.

Though we include the independently inverted density in the model file, density scaled using 
Gardner’s Law is preferred since our model has minimal sensitivity to density. Vp values 
from the original model can be used without scaling them from Vs.

The NetCDF file can be read in using xarray, which would allow users to pull all values from #4
for a given lat/lon/depth. I sent Mei a rudimentary python notebook earlier I use to quickly 
visualise data; I’m happy to make a more in-depth version if that would be of interest.

No, a GTL is not considered.

The minimum Vs is around 2000 m/s.

Yes! If there’s a preferred model format not on the Zenodo, though, please let me know and 
I’m happy to reformat the data.
Since the NetCDF file is a regularized grid, it seems like trilinear interpolation 
should be okay from my brief googling. I don’t know much about interpolation methods, 
though, so I’ll do some more digging.  The .h5 is an unstructured mesh that’s specific for
import into Salvus (the SEM code we use to invert our model).
Since CANVAS is optimized to fit waveforms, I generally use waveform cross-correlation
coefficients between model synthetics and observed data to test model integration. I’m 
open to trying other metrics, though, and can provide synthetic seismograms for testing as well.

Though not on your list, another important detail to note is that Moho topography is fixed
in the model. We honor Moho topography values from Crust1.0. I’m hoping that we’ll have 
the opportunity to use a regional Moho model in the future (e.g., Tape et al., 2012),
but doing so would require running more iterations of the model, which I currently don’t 
have funding to do.
